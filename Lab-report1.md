Installing the VScode did't take too much effort since I already have it on the computer.

2.Remotely Connecting

I first follow the instruction and reset the passwords, that isn't took too much time. But the reomote connection does not work out for me. I did reset the passwords, but when I type the password to log in, it just close the pathway. Might because I am still on the waitlist.

3.Trying Some Commands

Since the remote login didn't work out, some of the command does not gives output wantted. But it indeed shows some local file pathway on the computer.
